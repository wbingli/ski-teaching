# Week 5: Edging Control

**PSIA Fundamental 3**: Control edge angles through a combination of inclination and angulation.

**Goal**: Develop ability to control ski edge angles for grip, turn shape, and speed control.

---

## Why This Matters

When edge angles are controlled properly:
- **Grip on snow** - edges cut into snow instead of sliding
- **Turn shape control** - higher edge = tighter turn possible
- **Speed control** - edging + pressure = braking effect
- **Carving** - clean arcs instead of skidding

### Edge Angle Effects

| Edge Angle | Result |
|------------|--------|
| Flat | Ski slides sideways (sideslip) |
| Low angle | Skidded/brushed turns |
| Medium angle | Shaped turns with some skid |
| High angle | Carved turns (tail follows tip) |

---

## The Body Movement

> Lower legs incline toward the inside of the turn while the upper body tilts (angulates) toward the outside. This combination creates edge angle while maintaining balance.

### Two Ways to Create Edge Angle

**1. Inclination**
- Whole body tips toward inside of turn
- Simple but limited - too much = falling over
- Like a motorcycle leaning in a turn

**2. Angulation**
- Creating angles at joints (ankle, knee, hip)
- Upper body stays more upright
- Allows higher edge angles while balanced
- "Breaking" at the waist toward outside of turn

**Key Cue**: "Knees into the hill, shoulders level"

## Group A: Advanced (9-11 AM)

### Objectives
- Develop precise edge angle control
- Use combination of inclination and angulation
- Begin carving on appropriate terrain

### Session Plan

| Time | Activity | Terrain |
|------|----------|---------|
| 9:00-9:15 | Warm-up (review rotary focus) | Holiday |
| 9:15-9:30 | Demo edging mechanics | Gentle slope |
| 9:30-10:30 | Drills (see below) | Holiday → Blue |
| 10:30-10:50 | Carving application | Groomed blue |
| 10:50-11:00 | Wrap-up | Base area |

### Drills & Activities

**1. Side Slip to Edge Set (15 min)**
- From traverse position, flatten skis to slip sideways
- Increase edge angle to stop slipping
- Repeat: slip - set - slip - set
- **Purpose**: Feel edge angle control

**2. Linked Forward Sideslip (15 min)**
- Traverse, slip sideways, edge to traverse again
- Alternate directions down the hill
- Maintain parallel relationship
- **Purpose**: Dynamic edge control while moving

**3. J-Turns / Carved Arcs (15 min)**
- Start from traverse, roll onto edges
- Let skis carve an arc without steering
- Just edging, no rotary
- **Purpose**: Pure edge engagement feel

**4. Railroad Tracks (10 min)**
- Make turns trying to leave two clean lines in snow
- Tail should follow tip (no skidding)
- **Purpose**: Visual feedback on carve quality

**5. Angulation Focus (5 min)**
- While traversing, push hips into the hill
- Keep shoulders level with horizon
- Feel the edge bite increase
- **Purpose**: Isolate angulation movement
- 📹 [How to Carve on Skis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrmCNarCzIY) - Stomp It Tutorials (covers angulation)

### What to Watch For

| Good Signs | Needs Work |
|------------|------------|
| Ski tail follows tip | Tail washing/skidding out |
| Can see light under edge | Ski flat on snow |
| Angles visible at joints | Body leaning as one unit |
| Clean tracks in snow | Smeared/wide tracks |

### Common Errors & Fixes

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Skidding | Edge angle too low | Commit more to edge |
| Catching edges | Edge angle too high for speed | Reduce angle or add speed |
| Banking (no angulation) | Only using inclination | Hip angulation focus |
| A-frame | Over-edging inside ski | Focus on outside ski edge |
| Upper body leaning in | Counter-productive angulation | "Shoulders level" cue |

|------------|------------|
| Can hold traverse | Slipping down continuously |
| Feels edge engagement | "I don't feel anything different" |
| Can do basic sideslip | Scared of sideslipping |
| Understands tipping concept | Only thinking about steering |

### Common Errors & Fixes

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Catching downhill edge | Weight on wrong ski | Weight uphill in traverse |
| Can't sideslip | Edge angle too high | "Flatten your feet" |
| Fear of edging | Uncertainty | Low angle, slow speed |
| Knees locked | Stiffness | Soft knees, bounce slightly |

## PSIA Concepts Explained

### Inclination vs. Angulation

| | Inclination | Angulation |
|-|-------------|------------|
| **What** | Whole body tips | Joints create angles |
| **Where** | Entire body | Ankle, knee, hip |
| **Limit** | Falls over at extreme | Can maintain balance |
| **When used** | Low edge angles, fast | High edge angles, slow/medium |

### The Blending
Most skiing uses **both** inclination AND angulation:
- Inclination gets you started
- Angulation increases edge angle while staying balanced
- Amount varies by speed, turn shape, terrain

### Edge-Pressure Relationship

- **More pressure** on an edged ski = more grip
- **Less pressure** on an edged ski = easier to pivot/slide
- This is why we learned pressure (Week 3) before edging (Week 5)
- Outside ski: high pressure + high edge = carving

### Reading the Tracks

After your run, look at your tracks in the snow:
- **Clean lines** = good edging
- **Smeared/wide** = skidding
- **Two parallel lines** = both skis carving
- **One line only** = inside ski not doing much

---

## Assessment Criteria (from your guides)

**Edging** is achieved when:
- Ski tail follows ski tip
- Can see under the ski (edge angle visible)

---

## Side Slip to Edge Set (Versatility Task)

This is a **PSIA Level 1 required task**:

1. Stand across hill, skis pointing perpendicular to fall line
2. Slight flex, tipped on uphill edges
3. Extend to flatten skis → slip sideways down hill
4. Flex slightly, move knees uphill → edge to control speed
5. Flex more → stop completely

**Key Points**:
- Slip directly down (no forward/back drift)
- Skis stay perpendicular to fall line
- Smooth transitions between slip and set

---

## Terrain Notes

**Group A**: Holiday for drills, groomed blue (Central Express) for carving practice
**Group B**: Holiday only - edge awareness is challenging enough on green terrain

---

## Connection to Other Fundamentals

| Fundamental | How It Connects |
|-------------|-----------------|
| CoM/BoS | Angulation moves CoM to stay over BoS |
| Pressure | Pressure + edge = grip (they work together) |
| Rotary | Edge + steer together = shaped carved turn |
| Regulation | Flexion helps create edge angle |

---

## Homework for Students
- Stand and roll your feet to feel ankle movement
- Walk on an icy surface - notice how edging your shoes helps grip
- Look at your ski edges - feel how sharp they are

---

## Dry Land Workout

This week builds lateral stability - essential for strong edge control!

**1. Side Plank** (20 seconds each side x 2 sets)
- Lie on side, prop up on forearm, lift hips off ground
- Keep body in straight line from head to feet
- *Why it helps*: Lateral core strength supports angulation movements

**2. Lateral Hops** (10 hops each direction)
- Stand on one foot, hop sideways to land on the other foot
- Stick each landing with control before hopping back
- *Why it helps*: Builds lateral power and stability for edge-to-edge transitions

**3. Calf Raises** (15 reps x 3 sets)
- Stand on edge of step, rise up on toes, lower heels below step level
- Control the movement both up and down
- *Why it helps*: Strong calves support ankle movements for edge control
