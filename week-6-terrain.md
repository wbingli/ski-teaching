# Week 6: Terrain Progression & Skill Integration

**Goal**: Apply all five fundamentals on new, more challenging terrain. Test skills in real-world conditions.

---

## Why This Week Matters

After 5 weeks of isolated skill development:
- Time to **blend** all skills together
- See how skills **adapt** to different terrain
- Build **confidence** on new slopes
- Identify which skills need more practice

### The Integration Challenge
Good skiing isn't about using one skill at a time - it's about blending them all simultaneously:
- CoM/BoS + Pressure + Edging + Rotary + Regulation = Efficient skiing

---

## Group A: Advanced (9-11 AM)

### Objectives
- Ski more challenging blue and easy black terrain
- Apply all fundamentals in varied conditions
- Identify individual areas for continued development

### Session Plan

| Time | Activity | Terrain |
|------|----------|---------|
| 9:00-9:20 | Warm-up with skill review | Holiday |
| 9:20-10:30 | Progressive terrain challenge | See below |
| 10:30-10:50 | Free skiing observation | Student choice |
| 10:50-11:00 | Individual feedback | Base area |

### Terrain Progression

**Run 1: Holiday (Review)**
- Focus: Smooth, linked parallel turns
- Check: All fundamentals working together

**Run 2: Central Express Blue**
- Focus: Maintaining technique on steeper pitch
- Watch for: Balance (sitting back?), pressure (outside ski working?)

**Run 3: Central Express Blue - Short Radius**
- Focus: Quick turns, testing rotary + edge
- Watch for: Upper body stability, ski lead change

**Run 4: Central Express Blue - Long Radius**
- Focus: Carving, testing pressure + edge
- Watch for: Clean tracks, full ski engagement

**Run 5: Explore Easy Black (if conditions allow)**
- Focus: Adaptability, confidence
- Watch for: Fundamentals holding under challenge

### Skill Integration Activities

**1. Versatility Run (1 run)**
- Start with short radius turns
- Transition to medium radius
- Finish with long radius
- **Purpose**: Demonstrate skill adaptability

**2. Terrain Features (1 run)**
- Seek out rollers, side hills, transitions
- Notice how fundamentals adapt
- **Purpose**: Real-world application

**3. Variable Speed (1 run)**
- Alternate faster and slower sections
- Maintain technique at both speeds
- **Purpose**: Speed adaptability

### What to Watch For

| Skill | Strong Sign | Needs Work |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| CoM/BoS | Stays balanced on steeps | Sits back on steeps |
| Pressure | Outside ski solid | Inside ski heavy |
| Edging | Carving cleanly | Skidding on blues |
| Rotary | Upper body quiet | Rotating upper body |
| Regulation | Smooth, continuous | Jerky, stiff |

## Group B: Beginner (1-3 PM)

### Objectives
- Successfully ski first blue run!
- Build confidence on new terrain
- Celebrate 6 weeks of progress

### Session Plan

| Time | Activity | Terrain |
|------|----------|---------|
| 1:00-1:15 | Warm-up, confidence building | Holiday |
| 1:15-1:30 | Preview of blue terrain, Q&A | Base area |
| 1:30-2:30 | Blue terrain introduction | Central Express |
| 2:30-2:50 | Return to Holiday or more blue | Student choice |
| 2:50-3:00 | Celebration & feedback | Base area |

### Preparing for First Blue

**Mental Preparation**
- "You have all the skills you need"
- Blue is just a bit steeper
- Same movements, same technique
- Speed control through turn shape

**Physical Preparation**
- Review wedge turn fundamentals
- Practice speed control on Holiday
- Sideslip review (escape route if needed)

### Blue Run Approach

**First Run: Follow the Leader**
- Instructor leads, slow controlled pace
- Stop frequently to check in
- Take easiest line down

**Second Run: More Independence**
- Let students lead (one at a time)
- Instructor follows for safety
- Encourage finding their rhythm

**Third Run (if comfortable): Practice Focus**
- Pick one skill to focus on
- "Let's work on weight transfer"
- Make it a learning run, not just survival

### What to Watch For

| Good Signs | Support Needed |
|------------|----------------|
| Controlled speed | Going too fast, panicking |
| Linked turns | Straight running, scared to turn |
| Smiling, enjoying | Stiff, fearful, negative talk |
| Asking for more | Asking to go back to green |

### Common Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| "It's too steep!" | "Make smaller turns to control speed" |
| "I'm going too fast!" | "Turn more across the hill" |
| "I can't stop!" | Sideslip to edge set, or fall safely |
| "I want to go back" | Respect their limit, celebrate getting here |

### Emergency Skills Review
Before blue run, review:
1. **Controlled stop** - wedge, turn uphill
2. **Sideslip** - if stuck, can slip down
3. **Safe fall** - fall to the side, not forward/back
4. **Getting help** - stay put, wave for ski patrol if needed

## Skill Blending Concept

### How the Fundamentals Work Together

In a **single turn**, all five fundamentals happen:

| Phase | CoM/BoS | Pressure | Edging | Rotary | Regulation |
|-------|---------|----------|--------|--------|------------|
| **Initiation** | Move forward/inside | Transfer to new outside | Release old, engage new | Steer tips into fall line | Extend to release |
| **Shaping** | Maintain centered | Increase on outside | Build edge angle | Continue steering | Absorb terrain |
| **Finish** | Prepare for transition | Maximum on outside | Maximum edge | Complete steering | Flex to finish |

### The "Skill Blend" Mindset

No single skill is ever used alone:
- **Pressure without edging** = ski washes out
- **Edging without pressure** = no grip
- **Rotary without pressure** = spinning
- **CoM/BoS is always present** = it's the foundation

## Assessment: Before and After

Compare to Week 1:

**Group A (Advanced)**

| Skill | Week 1 | Week 6 |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Parallel turns | Basic | Refined |
| Blue terrain | Comfortable | Confident |
| Edge engagement | Skidding | Carving elements |
| Upper body | Some rotation | Quieter |

**Group B (Beginner)**

| Skill | Week 1 | Week 6 |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Wedge turns | Basic | Consistent |
| Green terrain | Nervous | Confident |
| Blue terrain | Never tried | First run! |
| Speed control | Reactive | Proactive |

---

## Terrain Notes

**Group A**:
- Central Express blues (all of them)
- Easy blacks if conditions and skill allow
- Variable terrain: rollers, side hills

**Group B**:
- Start on Holiday for confidence
- Move to easiest Central Express blue
- Return to green if needed (no shame!)

---

## Weather & Conditions Considerations

| Condition | Adjustment |
|-----------|------------|
| Icy | More edge angle, slower speed, careful |
| Fresh snow | Easier for beginners, requires balance adjustment |
| Crowded | Awareness, defensive skiing |
| Flat light | Slow down, hard to see terrain |
| Warm/slushy | Speed picks up, turn earlier |
