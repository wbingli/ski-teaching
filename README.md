## PSIA 5 Fundamentals Quick Reference

### 1. Center of Mass / Base of Support
> "Control the relationship of the center of mass to the base of support to direct pressure along the length of the skis."

**Body Movement**: Vary ankle/knee/hip flex to keep CoM over feet throughout the turn.

### 2. Ski-to-Ski Pressure
> "Control pressure from ski to ski and direct pressure toward the outside ski."

**Body Movement**: Legs move toward new turn direction; inside leg shortens through ankle/knee flexion while outside leg stays longer.

### 3. Edge Angles
> "Control edge angles through a combination of inclination and angulation."

**Body Movement**: Lower legs incline toward turn; upper body tilts (angulates) toward outside of turn.

### 4. Rotary
> "Control the skis' rotation with leg rotation, separate from the upper body."

**Body Movement**: Legs rotate in turn direction while upper body stays stable, aligned with intended path.

### 5. Pressure Regulation
> "Regulate the magnitude of pressure created through ski/snow interaction."

**Body Movement**: Vertical movements of ankles and knees to manage pressure (deeper flex = more pressure).

## Assessment Criteria (PSIA Level 1)

**Passing = 80% consistency**

| Element | What to Observe |
|---------|-----------------|
| CoM/BoS | Entire ski stays on snow |
| Outside ski | Tracks evenly, outside ankle more flexed |
| Edging | Tail follows tip |
| Rotation | Tips fall downhill at initiation |
| Pressure | Continuous movement in lower leg joints |
| Overall | Round turn shape, speed control |
