# Week 2: Center of Mass & Base of Support

**PSIA Fundamental 1**: Control the relationship of the center of mass to the base of support to direct pressure along the length of the skis.

**Goal**: Develop proper fore-aft balance to maintain uniform pressure along the entire ski.

---

## Why This Matters

When CoM is properly positioned over BoS:
- **Entire ski engages** with the snow (tip to tail)
- **Better turn initiation** - tips can enter the turn
- **More stability** - balanced athletic stance
- **Less fatigue** - efficient use of skeletal structure

### Common Problems from Poor Fore-Aft Balance
- **Too far back**: Tips light, hard to initiate turns, quad burn
- **Too far forward**: Tails wash out, loss of control

---

## The Body Movement

> Position center of mass over the center of the feet by varying the flex of ankle, knee, and hip joints throughout the turn.

**Key Cue**: "Shin pressure into the tongue of the boot"

---

## Group A: Advanced (9-11 AM)

### Objectives
- Refine fore-aft balance through varied terrain
- Develop dynamic adjustment of CoM through turn phases
- Understand how terrain changes require balance adjustments

### Session Plan

| Time | Activity | Terrain |
|------|----------|---------|
| 9:00-9:15 | Warm-up runs | Holiday |
| 9:15-9:30 | Skill intro & demo | Flat area |
| 9:30-10:30 | Drills (see below) | Holiday → Blue |
| 10:30-10:50 | Terrain application | Central Express |
| 10:50-11:00 | Wrap-up | Base area |

### Drills & Activities

**1. Shuffle Turns (15 min)**
- While making turns, shuffle feet fore and aft
- Exaggerate forward, then back, find center
- **Purpose**: Feel the range of balance, find optimal position

**2. Hands on Knees (10 min)**
- Ski with hands resting on knees
- Forces forward stance and ankle flex
- **Purpose**: Encourages proper athletic position

**3. 1000 Steps (15 min)**
- Make turns while stepping skis rapidly
- Quick, small steps throughout the turn
- **Purpose**: Requires centered balance to step effectively

**4. Pole Drag (10 min)**
- Drag both pole tips behind you while turning
- **Purpose**: Prevents sitting back, promotes forward stance

**5. Touch Boots (10 min)**
- Reach down and touch boot tops at turn initiation
- **Purpose**: Encourages forward movement into new turn

### What to Watch For

| Good Signs | Needs Work |
|------------|------------|
| Entire ski on snow | Tips or tails lifting |
| Shin touching boot tongue | Gap at shin, weight on heels |
| Quiet upper body | Upper body compensating |
| Smooth continuous motion | Abrupt movements |

### Common Errors & Fixes

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Sitting back | Fear, habit, stiff ankles | Hands on knees drill |
| Tips washing out | Too aggressive forward lean | Find neutral, not extreme forward |
| Bouncing | Over-flexing/extending | Smooth continuous ankle flex |

---

## Group B: Beginner (1-3 PM)

### Objectives
- Establish athletic stance with proper balance
- Develop awareness of shin-to-boot pressure
- Maintain balance through wedge turns

### Session Plan

| Time | Activity | Terrain |
|------|----------|---------|
| 1:00-1:15 | Warm-up wedge runs | Holiday |
| 1:15-1:30 | Stance demo & practice | Flat area |
| 1:30-2:30 | Drills (see below) | Holiday |
| 2:30-2:50 | Linked turns focus | Holiday |
| 2:50-3:00 | Wrap-up | Base area |

### Drills & Activities

**1. Athletic Stance Check (10 min)**
- On flat ground, find balanced position
- Ankles flexed, knees over toes, hands forward
- "Ready position" like a tennis player or goalkeeper
- **Purpose**: Establish baseline stance

**2. Straight Run Balance (15 min)**
- Straight run down gentle slope
- Focus on feeling shin pressure against boot
- Stop in wedge
- **Purpose**: Feel balanced position while moving

**3. Airplane Turns (15 min)**
- Arms out to sides like airplane wings
- Make wedge turns
- If falling back, arms naturally come forward
- **Purpose**: Self-correction tool for balance

**4. Touch the Knees (10 min)**
- While in straight run or gentle turn, briefly touch knees
- **Purpose**: Requires forward balance to reach knees

**5. One Ski Scooter (10 min)**
- Remove one ski, push with that foot
- Glide on remaining ski in balanced position
- **Purpose**: Develops balance awareness on single ski

### What to Watch For

| Good Signs | Needs Work |
|------------|------------|
| Relaxed, flexed stance | Stiff, locked legs |
| Weight on balls of feet | Weight on heels |
| Hands visible in periphery | Hands behind body |
| Consistent wedge | Wedge changing size erratically |

### Common Errors & Fixes

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Leaning back | Fear of speed, stiff ankles | "Nose over toes" cue |
| Arms flailing | Balance compensation | Hands on hips drill |
| Looking at skis | Uncertainty | "Look where you want to go" |

## PSIA Concepts Explained

### Center of Mass (CoM)
- The point where your body's mass is concentrated
- Approximately at your belly button / pelvis
- Moves as you move

### Base of Support (BoS)
- The area between your skis and boots
- Wider stance = larger BoS = more stable
- Narrower stance = smaller BoS = more dynamic

### The Relationship
- CoM should remain within the BoS for balance
- As terrain changes, must adjust to keep CoM over BoS
- **Transition** (turn initiation): CoM moves toward new turn
- **Shaping** (middle of turn): CoM moves inside turn
- **Finish**: CoM centered, ready for next transition

### Ankle Flex is Key
- Ankles are the primary joint for fore-aft adjustment
- Stiff ankles = poor balance response
- Flexible ankles = quick adjustments possible

---

## Terrain Notes

**Group A**: Start on Holiday for drills, progress to Central Express blues for application
**Group B**: Stay on Holiday - focus on mastering stance before adding terrain challenge

---

## Homework for Students
- Practice athletic stance at home (no skis needed)
- Stand on one foot - notice ankle adjustments for balance
- Visualize shin pressure against an imaginary boot

---

- [ ] Students understand CoM/BoS relationship
- [ ] Each student can demonstrate athletic stance
- [ ] Fore-aft balance improved from Week 1
- [ ] Common errors identified and addressed
- [ ] Preview Week 3: Ski-to-ski pressure
