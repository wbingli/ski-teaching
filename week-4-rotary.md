# Week 4: Rotary Control

**PSIA Fundamental 4**: Control the skis' rotation (turning, pivoting, steering) with leg rotation, separate from the upper body.

**Goal**: Develop independent leg steering while maintaining a stable, quiet upper body.

---

## Why This Matters

When rotary is controlled properly:
- **Turn shape flexibility** - can turn tighter or wider than ski's natural radius
- **Upper body stability** - better balance and vision
- **Efficient movement** - legs do the work, not whole body
- **Adaptability** - essential for bumps, steeps, variable terrain

### The Problem with Upper Body Rotation
- Throws weight to inside of turn (bad for pressure)
- Disrupts balance
- Creates inefficient "windshield wiper" skiing
- Makes it harder to link turns

---

## The Body Movement

> Legs rotate in the direction of the turn while the upper body stays generally aligned with the intended path down the hill. This creates separation between lower and upper body.

**Key Cue**: "Turn your feet, not your shoulders" or "Belly button faces down the hill"

---

## Group A: Advanced (9-11 AM)

### Objectives
- Develop strong separation between upper and lower body
- Use leg steering to control turn shape independent of speed
- Apply in varied terrain including steeper blues

### Session Plan

| Time | Activity | Terrain |
|------|----------|---------|
| 9:00-9:15 | Warm-up (review pressure focus) | Holiday |
| 9:15-9:30 | Demo separation & leg steering | Holiday |
| 9:30-10:30 | Drills (see below) | Holiday → Blue |
| 10:30-10:50 | Terrain application | Central Express |
| 10:50-11:00 | Wrap-up | Base area |

### Drills & Activities

**1. Pivot Slips (15 min)**
- From a standstill, pivot skis 180° left, then right
- Keep upper body facing downhill
- Use pure leg rotation
- **Purpose**: Isolates rotary movement without sliding

**2. Pole Drag - Tips in Snow (15 min)**
- Drag both pole tips in the snow
- Poles stay pointed downhill as you turn
- Forces upper body to stay quiet
- **Purpose**: Prevents upper body rotation

**3. Hands on Hips (10 min)**
- Place hands on hips while making turns
- Focus on hips staying relatively level
- Feel legs rotating underneath
- **Purpose**: Awareness of hip/leg separation

**4. Upper Body Quiet Turns (10 min)**
- Hold poles horizontally across chest
- Poles should stay pointed roughly downhill
- Legs turn, shoulders don't
- **Purpose**: Visual feedback on upper body stability
- 📹 [How to Carve on Skis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrmCNarCzIY) - Stomp It Tutorials (covers upper body)

**5. Bull Fighter Turns (10 min)**
- Hold poles wide like a matador's cape
- Keep "cape" facing downhill
- Legs turn underneath the stable upper body
- **Purpose**: Dramatic separation drill

### What to Watch For

| Good Signs | Needs Work |
|------------|------------|
| Upper body faces general fall line | Shoulders rotating with skis |
| Legs visibly rotating | Whole body rotating as unit |
| Pole tips stay forward | Poles swinging side to side |
| Ski lead change occurs | No lead change (skis parallel throughout) |

### Common Errors & Fixes

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Counter-rotation | Over-rotating upper body opposite | Reduce movement, find neutral |
| No lead change | Insufficient leg rotation | Pivot slips, exaggerate |
| Banking (whole body leaning) | Not using leg rotation, just leaning | Pole drag drill |
| Square hips | Not enough rotation | Active femur rotation focus |

### Ski Lead Change

The **ski lead change** is key indicator of rotary:
- At turn initiation, the new outside (uphill) ski is slightly ahead
- Through the turn, skis become even, then new inside pulls ahead
- This happens naturally with proper leg rotation
- **No lead change** = insufficient rotary movement

---

## Group B: Beginner (1-3 PM)

### Objectives
- Understand that legs steer the skis, not the body
- Develop active steering in wedge turns
- Begin building upper/lower body separation awareness

### Session Plan

| Time | Activity | Terrain |
|------|----------|---------|
| 1:00-1:15 | Warm-up wedge runs (pressure review) | Holiday |
| 1:15-1:30 | Explain & demo leg steering | Flat area |
| 1:30-2:30 | Drills (see below) | Holiday |
| 2:30-2:50 | Linked turns with steering focus | Holiday |
| 2:50-3:00 | Wrap-up | Base area |

### Drills & Activities

**1. Clock Turns (10 min)**
- Stand on flat ground in wedge
- Imagine clock face on snow
- Turn feet to point at 3 o'clock, then 9 o'clock
- Upper body stays facing 12 o'clock
- **Purpose**: Basic rotation concept without speed

**2. Steering Wedge Turns (20 min)**
- Focus on actively turning both feet in direction of turn
- Not just tipping, but rotating the feet
- "Point your toes where you want to go"
- **Purpose**: Active steering development
- 📹 [How to Snow Plough Turn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEBIAfZ0iW4) - SKNG Ski School

**3. Follow the Leader - Copy Legs (15 min)**
- Follow instructor, watch their legs
- Notice how legs turn while body stays stable
- Try to copy the movement
- **Purpose**: Visual learning

**4. "Twist Your Feet" (10 min)**
- On each turn, think about twisting feet in the boot
- Like wringing out a towel
- **Purpose**: Internal rotation cue

**5. Look Down the Hill (5 min)**
- Focus eyes on something down the hill
- Keep looking at it while making turns
- **Purpose**: Promotes upper body stability

### What to Watch For

| Good Signs | Needs Work |
|------------|------------|
| Tips fall into turn | Skis stay pointed straight |
| Active foot steering | Passive, waiting for gravity |
| Shoulders relatively quiet | Whole body rotating |
| Continuous turn shape | Start-stop turning |

### Common Errors & Fixes

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Upper body leading | Trying to muscle the turn | "Turn feet, not shoulders" |
| Looking at skis | Uncertainty, trying to see | "Look where you want to go" |
| Z-turns (no steering) | Letting gravity do all work | Active steering emphasis |
| Tip crossing | Over-rotating one ski | Equal steering both feet |

## PSIA Concepts Explained

### Rotary vs. Rotation

**Rotary** = The skill of controlling ski direction through leg movement
**Rotation** = The actual turning movement

We want:
- **Active rotary** in the legs
- **Minimal rotation** in the upper body

### Types of Rotary Movement

1. **Steering** - Gradual, continuous rotation of legs through turn
2. **Pivoting** - Quick rotation, usually at slow speeds
3. **Guiding** - Light steering to shape the turn

### Where Rotary is Most Important

| Turn Phase | Rotary Role |
|------------|-------------|
| Initiation | Pivot/steer tips into fall line |
| Shaping | Guide turn arc with continuous steering |
| Finish | Steer across fall line for speed control |

### Separation (Counter)

- Upper body "counters" the leg rotation
- Creates torsion through the core
- Allows quick transitions between turns
- More separation needed in:
  - Short radius turns
  - Steep terrain
  - Bumps

---

## Assessment Criteria (from your guides)

**Rotation** is achieved when:
- Tips fall downhill at initiation
- Ski lead change occurs
- Skis maintain relationship required for the activity

---

## Terrain Notes

**Group A**: Holiday for drills, Central Express blues for application
**Group B**: Holiday - master steering before adding terrain challenge

---

## Connection to Other Fundamentals

| Fundamental | How It Connects |
|-------------|-----------------|
| CoM/BoS | Stable upper body helps maintain CoM position |
| Pressure | Steering is more effective with weighted outside ski |
| Edging | Rotary + edging together create carved turn |
| Regulation | Rotary helps manage pressure buildup |

---

## Homework for Students
- Stand and rotate just your legs while keeping shoulders still
- Notice how hips and legs can move independently
- Watch good skiers - observe their quiet upper body

---

## Dry Land Workout

This week targets core stability - the foundation for upper/lower body separation!

**1. Plank Hold** (30 seconds x 3 sets)
- Forearms and toes on ground, body in straight line
- Keep core tight, don't let hips sag or pike up
- *Why it helps*: Core stability allows upper body to stay quiet while legs work

**2. Standing Hip Circles** (10 circles each direction)
- Stand on one leg, make circles with the other leg's knee
- Keep upper body still while hips rotate
- *Why it helps*: Develops hip mobility and separation from upper body

**3. Bird-Dogs** (8 each side x 2 sets)
- On hands and knees, extend opposite arm and leg
- Keep core stable, don't let hips rotate
- *Why it helps*: Trains core to resist rotation - key for quiet upper body skiing
