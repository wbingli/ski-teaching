# Week 3: Ski-to-Ski Pressure Control

**PSIA Fundamental 2**: Control pressure from ski to ski and direct pressure toward the outside ski.

**Goal**: Develop ability to weight the outside ski for turn shape control and stability.

---

## Why This Matters

When pressure is directed toward the outside ski:
- **Turn shape is controlled** - outside ski carves the arc
- **Stability** - platform to push against
- **Edge engagement** - pressure + edge = grip
- **Efficient skiing** - let the ski do the work

### The Physics
- During a turn, centrifugal force pushes you to the outside
- Outside ski needs enough pressure to resist this force
- Inside ski stays light, ready to adjust

---

## The Body Movement

> At turn initiation, legs move slightly toward new turn while hips remain centered. As turn develops, inside leg shortens through ankle/knee flexion, allowing hips to move inside. Outside leg stays flexed but longer, increasing pressure on outside ski.

**Key Cue**: "Heavy outside foot" or "Stand on the downhill ski"

---

## Group A: Advanced (9-11 AM)

### Objectives
- Develop precise weight transfer to outside ski
- Maintain pressure through entire turn arc
- Apply skill on blue terrain at speed

### Session Plan

| Time | Activity | Terrain |
|------|----------|---------|
| 9:00-9:15 | Warm-up runs (review CoM/BoS) | Holiday |
| 9:15-9:30 | Demo outside ski pressure | Holiday |
| 9:30-10:30 | Drills (see below) | Holiday → Blue |
| 10:30-10:50 | Terrain application | Central Express |
| 10:50-11:00 | Wrap-up | Base area |

### Drills & Activities

**1. Javelin Turns (15 min)**
- Lift inside ski tail, tip touching snow (like a javelin)
- Make complete turns on outside ski only
- Inside ski acts as outrigger for balance
- **Purpose**: Forces 100% weight on outside ski

**2. Outside Ski Lift (10 min)**
- During each turn, briefly lift inside ski completely
- Just a moment of lift, then set down
- **Purpose**: Confirms weight is on outside ski

**3. Railroad Track Turns (15 min)**
- Focus on making two clean tracks in snow
- Outside ski should leave deeper track
- **Purpose**: Visual feedback on pressure distribution

**4. Pivot Slip to Turn (10 min)**
- Side slip, then pivot into turn on outside ski
- Feel pressure build on outside ski through turn
- **Purpose**: Pressure awareness through turn phases

**5. White Pass Turns (10 min)**
- Leave inside ski flat on snow, lift the edge
- All pressure and edging on outside ski
- **Purpose**: Isolates outside ski for maximum feedback

### What to Watch For

| Good Signs | Needs Work |
|------------|------------|
| Outside ski tracks evenly | Outside ski chattering/skidding |
| Outside ankle more flexed | Both ankles same flex |
| Inside ski light (could lift) | Weight stuck on inside ski |
| Smooth weight transfer | Abrupt/late weight transfer |

### Common Errors & Fixes

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Inside ski heavy | Habit, fear of committing | Javelin turns, force the lift |
| Late transfer | Waiting too long | Transfer at turn start, not end |
| A-frame (knees together) | Over-edging inside ski | Focus on outside ski only |
| Hip drop to inside | Over-committing inside | Keep hips more level |

---

## Group B: Beginner (1-3 PM)

### Objectives
- Develop awareness of weight distribution
- Begin shifting weight to outside ski in wedge turns
- Prepare foundation for wedge christie

### Session Plan

| Time | Activity | Terrain |
|------|----------|---------|
| 1:00-1:15 | Warm-up wedge runs (review stance) | Holiday |
| 1:15-1:30 | Explain & demo weight shift | Flat area |
| 1:30-2:30 | Drills (see below) | Holiday |
| 2:30-2:50 | Linked turns with weight focus | Holiday |
| 2:50-3:00 | Wrap-up | Base area |

### Drills & Activities

**1. Heavy Foot Awareness (10 min)**
- Stand in wedge on flat ground
- Shift weight to one foot, then the other
- Notice which ski moves more
- **Purpose**: Basic weight awareness

**2. Step Turns (15 min)**
- Make turns by stepping from ski to ski
- Step onto the ski you want to turn around
- Exaggerated movement to feel weight shift
- **Purpose**: Clear weight transfer feeling

**3. Falling Leaf (15 min)**
- Traverse, then let skis slip downhill
- Shift weight to uphill ski to traverse again
- Back and forth like a falling leaf
- **Purpose**: Feel how weight affects direction

**4. "Push the Pedal" Turns (15 min)**
- Imagine gas pedals under each foot
- Press the "pedal" of the ski you want to turn around
- Right pedal = turn left, Left pedal = turn right
- **Purpose**: Simple mental model for beginners

**5. Pointer Turns (5 min)**
- Point to the outside ski during each turn
- "This is my turning ski!"
- **Purpose**: Cognitive reinforcement

### What to Watch For

| Good Signs | Needs Work |
|------------|------------|
| Weight shift visible | Weight stays centered |
| Outside ski flattens more | Both skis equal edge |
| Rounder turn shape | Skidded/abrupt turns |
| Student can describe feeling | "I don't know which foot" |

### Common Errors & Fixes

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| No visible weight shift | Not understanding concept | Step turns, exaggerate |
| Shifting too late | Timing confusion | "Shift at start of turn" |
| Upper body leaning | Using body instead of legs | Keep shoulders level |
| Wedge getting narrow | Weight pulling skis together | Maintain wedge width |

## PSIA Concepts Explained

### Why Outside Ski?

1. **Platform for Turning**
   - Outside ski is the "carving" ski
   - Needs pressure to bend into an arc
   - More pressure = tighter turn possible

2. **Balance Against Forces**
   - Centrifugal force pushes you outside
   - Outside ski is your resistance
   - Like leaning on a railing

3. **Edge Engagement**
   - Pressure + edge angle = grip
   - Outside ski has higher edge angle
   - Combining pressure with edge creates carve

### Pressure Distribution Through Turn

| Turn Phase | Outside Ski | Inside Ski |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| Initiation | ~60% | ~40% |
| Fall line | ~70-80% | ~20-30% |
| Finish | ~80% | ~20% |

### Inside Leg Movement
- Inside leg shortens through the turn
- Ankle and knee flex more than outside
- Allows hips to move inside for angulation
- "Long outside leg, short inside leg"

---

## Assessment Criteria (from your guides)

**Outside ski pressure** is achieved when:
- Outside ski tracks evenly on the snow
- Outside ankle is flexed more than inside ankle

---

## Terrain Notes

**Group A**: Start drills on Holiday, progress to Central Express for application
**Group B**: Stay on Holiday - master weight shift before terrain progression

---

## Connection to Other Fundamentals

| Fundamental | How It Connects |
|-------------|-----------------|
| CoM/BoS | CoM moves toward outside ski for pressure |
| Edging | Pressure + edge = carving grip |
| Rotary | Steering is more effective with weighted ski |
| Regulation | Flexion/extension affects pressure amount |

---

## Homework for Students
- Stand on one foot at home - notice stability
- When walking, feel weight transfer foot to foot
- Visualize "heavy outside foot" during turns
