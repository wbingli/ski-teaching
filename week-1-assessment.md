## Group B: Beginner (1-3 PM)

### Objectives
- Confirm students can wedge turn on greens
- Assess comfort level with chairlift
- Build confidence and establish safe learning environment

### Session Plan

| Time | Activity | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| 1:00-1:15 | **Introductions at Ullr Hut** | Names, experience level, any fears/concerns |
| 1:15-1:30 | **Flat ground warm-up** | Stretching, sliding, falling/getting up |
| 1:30-1:45 | **Chairlift ride to Holiday** | Assess chairlift comfort |
| 1:45-2:30 | **Wedge turn assessment** | Series of runs on Holiday |
| 2:30-2:45 | **Straight run & speed control** | Check balance and stopping ability |
| 2:45-3:00 | **Wrap-up & questions** | Address concerns, preview Week 2 |

### Skill Check Activities

**1. Wedge Position Check (5 min)**
- Static wedge on flat ground
- Watch for: even wedge, comfortable stance

**2. Gliding Wedge (10 min)**
- Straight run in wedge, control speed
- Watch for: consistent wedge width, balance

**3. Wedge Turns (20 min)**
- Linked turns down Holiday
- Watch for: both skis on snow, round turns, steering both legs

**4. Stopping (5 min)**
- Can they stop when they want to?
- Watch for: controlled stop vs panic stop

### What to Observe

| Element | Green Flag | Yellow Flag |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| Balance | Centered, relaxed | Leaning back, stiff |
| Wedge | Consistent, comfortable | Catching edges, unstable |
| Turning | Steering both legs | Turning only one ski |
| Confidence | Comfortable, smiling | Fearful, tense |

### Adult Learner Considerations
- Adults 35+ may have:
  - Fear of injury
  - Less flexibility
  - More analytical approach
  - Need for understanding "why"
- Be patient, explain the purpose behind each activity
- Celebrate small wins

## PSIA Concepts for Week 1

### CAP Model (Learning Stages)
- **Cognitive**: Understanding what to do (most beginners here)
- **Associative**: Practicing and refining (most of Group A)
- **Autonomous**: Automatic movements (goal for both groups)

### Teaching Cycle
1. **Assess** - Watch current ability
2. **Plan** - Determine what they need
3. **Present** - Introduce new concept
4. **Practice** - Guided activities
5. **Assess again** - Check progress

---

## Terrain

**Group A**: Start on Holiday, progress to Central Express blues
**Group B**: Stay on Holiday for entire session

---

## Equipment Check
- Boots properly buckled?
- Bindings recently serviced?
- Poles correct length?
- Clothing appropriate for conditions?
